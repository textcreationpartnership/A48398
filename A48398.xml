            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe holy Spirit tells us, that whilſt the wicked are to periſh as their own dung their names rot, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories blotted out, and cut off from the Earth. That the memory of the Juſt is to be bleſſed, to be had in everlaſting remembrance, and as an eternal excelleny, they are to be the joy of many Generations.</p>
            <p>And therefore is it that the Pen men of the Scripture have been ſo careful to tranſmit to poſterity, ſo faithful an account of the Worthies of former Generations, to instruct others (no doubt in like manner) to Record, and Preſerve the memories of Worthy men in after Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>And ſurely not without ſpecial deſign of ſingular uſe, and advantage when we conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> how much it tends to vindicate and preſerve the precious ſavour of their names, who for righteouſneſs ſake have been vilified, and reproached, caſt out as evil, and eſteemed as Dung, and off ſcouring. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How much God is like to be glorified on their behalf, for puttting ſo much Heavenly Treaſure in Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Veſſels, and ſo fully magnifying his grace in them, and by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> (and eſpecially) by the holding forth thoſ Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Graces, and Excellencies, that ſhined in them, they may though dead, yet be ſpeaking, and ſo become living Monuments, Patterns, Examples, and Preachers, to them that come after them. So that their Faith, Love, Patience, Humility, Zeal, Courage, Wiſdom, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, may provoke, inſtruct, and comfort many: Their Temptations Tribulations, patient Sufferings, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, help, and ſtrengthen more.</p>
            <p>And of admirable uſe to the Church (no doubt) in all
<pb facs="tcp:43443:3"/>
ages have been the Books of Martyrs, and Lives of the Eminent Saints, and Confeſſors, that have done, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered worthily in their dayes: Men for the moſt part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apter to be Governed by Example than by Precept.</p>
            <p>And therefore are thoſe frequent, and ſpecial Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Heb. 6.9. Be ye followers of them, who through faith and patience, have inherited Promiſes.</hi> Jam. <hi>5.10. Take my Brethren the Prophets, who have ſpoken to you in the name of the Lord, for an Example of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affliction, and of patience.</hi> Heb. <hi>13.7. Remember them which had the rule over you, whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their converſation.</hi> Prov. <hi>2.20. That thou mayeſt walk in the wayes of good men, and keep the paths of the Righteous.</hi> Cant. <hi>1.8. Go thy way forth by the footſteps of the Flock.</hi> Pſal. <hi>37.37. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> Heb. <hi>12.1. Wherefore ſeeing we are alſo compaſſed about with ſo great a Cloud of Witneſſes</hi> (viz. the Catalogue of Eminent Saints, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, &amp; Confeſſors in the former Chapter) <hi>let us lay aſide</hi> (after their Example) <hi>every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet, and let us run with patience, the race ſet before us, looking as eſpecially unto Jeſus.</hi> Heb. <hi>12.2. So alſo to</hi> Abraham <hi>our Father.</hi> Eſ. <hi>51.1. That we may walk in his Steps.</hi> Rom. <hi>4.12.</hi> The good Kings in <hi>Iſrael</hi> took <hi>David</hi> for their Pattern, and therefore are ſaid to do right as did <hi>David</hi> their Father, walking in his way: The evil Kings were ſaid not to walk with him, but taking <hi>Jeroboam</hi> for their Example to follow his ſteps.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A faithful record of the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of good men, is of excellent uſe to help forward the conviction, or agravate and further the condemnation of malicious Perſecutors; who may thereby better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand who they are they have gone forth against, what Perſons of honour, worth, and renown, and how like the Children of Kings, <hi>Judg. 8.18.</hi> And that the reaſon of
<pb facs="tcp:43443:3"/>
their ſo lifting up hand and heel againſt them, is no other than theirs of old mentioned, <hi>1 Joh. 3.12. Joh. 5.16. Joh. 15.18, 19, 21. Joh. 16.2, 3. &amp; 8.44. 1 Cor. 2.8. Joh. 7.7. Pſal. 35.7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to be informed therefore, of that undoubted wrath and vengeance that will certainly overtake all ſuch, who not only imbrue their hands in the innocent blood of the Righteous in their day (which cries for vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them) but become guilty alſo, of all the blood that from the beginning of the World, upon like account, and in like ſpirit hath been ſhed, as <hi>Mat. 23.34, 35.</hi> And that what evil, in word, or deed, hath been done to any of the Saints, upon the account of Righteouſneſs, is reckoned as done to the very perſon of Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 25.31, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That Gods diſpleaſure, and voyce of his Rod, to the Generation where ſuch stroaks are, may be the better felt, heard, and layed to heart, where ſuch perſons of worth and excellency are ſnatcht away, ſuch Angels, Ambaſſadours, Fathers recalled ſuch ſhining Stars, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lights, ſavoury Salt taken away, ſuch Chariots and Horſemen of <hi>Iſrael</hi> removed, foretelling greater judgements alſo neer at hand, and loudly calling for due ſearch after the cauſe, <hi>Jer. 2.20.</hi> as well as a true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſpeedy reformation for the ſame.</p>
            <p>And ſo is the preſerved Memory of the Juſt bleſſed, to the glory of God, to preſent and future Generations, to Saints and Sinners, good and bad, here and hereafter, in this World, and that which is to come.</p>
            <p>In which bleſſed Service, is this deſigned undertaking, to be adding another Link to the Chain of Worthies, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witneſs, to the Cloud of Witneſſes: by endeavouring hereby to recommend, and preſerve, his precious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, who by the account yet obtained of him, you will perceive hath attained ſo good a degree, done ſo worthily in <hi>Ephra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43443:4"/>Which may be more obvious when you conſider what is faithfully ſaid of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In his eminent Converſion, who was taken in his Enmity and prophaneſs, led gradually through legal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, terrours, and bonds to Goſpel light, love, and liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In his ſignal temptations, and tribulations, inward, and outward, by Sin, World, Satan, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſupports under all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In his Narraritical dedication to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, wherein his dexterous and eminent skill, unwearied activity, ſingular faithfulneſs, and admirable ſucceſs, appeared beyond many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the perils, hazards, jeopardies, perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, impriſonments that he underwent for the Goſpel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that (it is conceived) it may be as truly ſaid of him, as any ſince the primitive days, what was ſaid of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 6.4, &amp;c. 11.26, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have ſome account of him, not only in his heart-walk, but in his Houſe Church, and Generation walk alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> You have ſome diſcovery of his heart-walk, out of ſome part of his Diary, wherein you find his vigilant, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, and ſteady watch, not only to improve the motions of the ſpirit, but to withſtand the motions of ſin and Satan: his cloſe and hard perſuit after God, by all ways &amp; means to keep the heart clean, and the life holy, to keep up grace in the act, &amp; godlineſs in the power thereof, obſerving daily his ſpiritual experiences both in his gettings, &amp; loſings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have ſome account alſo of him in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-walk (which ſo much be ſpeaks the Chriſtian) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you find him as a man of knowledge, filling up every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the fear of God, managing his affairs with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doing not only the things that were juſt and equal, but ſingular alſo. Deſigning with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that he, and his houſe might ſerve the Lord, which he cared for in the firſt place, witneſſing therein a ſingular love and regard to all the ſouls under his roof. A ſtrict and zealous obſerver of
<pb facs="tcp:43443:4"/>
the Sabbath, a great lover of Hoſpitality, adminiſtring with liberal heart and hand to all, eſpecially to the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Faith, inſomuch that the bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon him, cauſing the widows heart to ſing for joy, eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, a father to the poor, and the cauſe he knew not, he ſearched out, <hi>Job 29.30, 31.</hi> and ſo diviſing liberal things, by liberal things he ſtood.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have ſome thing of him alſo in his Church-walk, wherein he approved himſelf a workman that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word, to every one a portion, giving bread in due ſeaſon; taking heed to himſelf, and to all the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt had made him an Overſeer, to feed the Church of God, which he purchaſed with his own blood, taking the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight thereof, not by conſtraint but willingly, not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind. And having the word of God dwelling richly with him in all wiſdom, did teach, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, in Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs. A true lover, and an affectionate promoter of peace and holineſs, a zealous, and impartial withſtander of ſin, errour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs. One that had dexterous skill to get into the hearts of ſinners. And one to whom the Lord had given the tongue of the Learned, that knew how to ſpeak a word in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to him that was weary, very compaſſionate, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted, full of true ſympothy, and fellow feeling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all weakneſſes, and temptations, that attended any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experimentally able to adminiſter conſolation by the comfort wherewith he himſelf (under many tryals) had been ſupported, and comforted by the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You have ſome account alſo how he behaved himſelf in his Generation-Walk, wherein you will find he witneſſed in a publick ſpirit much ſincere love to his Country, great faithfulneſs, courage, and activity to the Cauſe and Intereſt of Chriſt, as it was stated for him againſt Antichrist, and ſo covenanted for, &amp; pleaded in his

day. And in the aſſerting and managing thereof (it may be ſaid of him that) he bore in his Body the marks of our Lord Jeſus, and to which he was faithful from firſt to laſt, even to death. And not with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that appeared ſo zealouſly, curſing <hi>Merozat</hi> firſt for not helping the Lord againſt the mighty, and ſoon after fell in with the mighty against the Lord: Nor with ſo many Princes, Elders, and Father's (contrary to former Covenants and Ingagements) who made a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to go back again into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to the building again the things that they had pulled down, and pulling down the things they had built. But did in that day of tryal, you'll find, as zealouſly, and impartially, withſtand his Friends for Hypocriſy, and Apoſtacy, as others, for Prophaneſs and Superſtition, foretelling, and lamenting ſuch ſteps, as the certain foundation of ruine, and confuſion.</p>
            <p>Neither did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e ſee cauſe, as an evil doer, in reproach to Chriſt, and his cauſe pleaded by him, to beg and give thanks for pardon, for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him. Nor to deny, forſake, and forſwear his Maſter, and Crucified Cauſe, but with courage and faithfulneſs, you'll find him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo keeping the word of his patience, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Generation according to the will of God, he fell aſleep, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the aſſured Faith, and Hope of the Reſurrection of that Cauſe that he had ſo done, and ſuffered for; ſo lived, and dyed in.</p>
            <p>It is true, under all the Worth and Excellency ſpoken of, you'll find him alſo, a man of like paſsions with his Brethren, and not without his infirmities, having all this Heavenly Treaſure in an Earthen Veſſel, and being a Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as a man of God, that he might not be eſteemed of more than was meet, and that Chriſt alone might have the preheminency, to be the great Example, and to be imitated in all things, the beſt of men being no otherwiſe to be followed, than as they follow Chriſt, becauſe, as ſaith the Apoſtle, in many things we offend all. The natural infirmity that he much groaned under, and complained of, was, paſsion and raſhneſs, and which he would, when overtaken with, make haſte out of, and with due acknowledgements for his evil therein, return ſpeedily to a ſweet frame and temper again.</p>
            <p>It remains, that ſince the pleaſure of the Lord is thus manifeſted in the removing ſuch a Father, with many other ſuch like eminent ones a late from us; that the due improvement of ſuch ſad provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences be endeavoured according to the ends before hinted; whereby our holy <hi>Powels,</hi> excellent <hi>Bridges,</hi> worthy <hi>Blakes,</hi> faithful <hi>Woods,</hi> may yet, though dead, live, and preach to us; and may be a means to help forward the cry of doubling the ſpirit of the <hi>Elias's</hi> that are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, upon the <hi>Eliſha's</hi> remaining.</p>

world, and juſtly tearmed as I was by my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and School-fellows, <hi>Dux omnium malorum,</hi> Captain or Leader of or in all evil, only drunkenneſs I much hated, looking upon it as ſuch an unnatural thing that the moſt greedy ſilly Beaſts abſtain from it, and I wondred that perſons could delight in that which had neither true pleaſure profit nor honour in it; I had no eſteem for the holy Scriptures, nor cared at all to look into them, but either Hyſtorical or Poetical Books, Romances and the like were all my delight, the Sabbath I much profaned by all ſports, though God was pleaſed to magnifie his grace ſo much as to make that the occaſion of my Converſion: For being one Lords day a ſtander by and beholder of thoſe that broke the Sabbath by divers Games, being then my ſelf a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Common-Prayers, and in the habit of a fooliſh Shepheard, I was aſhamed to play with them, yet took as much pleaſure therein as if I had; whereupon a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grave Profeſſour of Religion (one of thoſe then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Puritans</hi>) ſeeing me there, came to me, and very ſoberly and mildly asked me, doth it become you Sir that are a Scholar and one that teacheth others, to break the Lords Sabbath thus? to whom I anſwered as thoſe ſcoffers in <hi>Malachy,</hi> Wherein do I break it; you ſee me onely ſtand by but I do not play at all; to which he replyed, but you find your own pleaſure herein by looking on, and this God forbids in his holy Word, ſo he opened his Bible and read theſe words in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58.13. and perticularly that expreſſion. <hi>Not finding thy own pleaſure upon the ſabbath day;</hi> ſuch was the partinency of the place and the power that came with the word, I was for the preſent ſilent, and took it ſo far into conſideration, as to reſolve never to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the like kind again, which reſolution God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me to perform, though as yet I was not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of my loſt eſtate by nature, nor of the want of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43443:6"/>But about a year after I had a call to hear a godly excellent Preacher, who in his Uſes ſhew d that they who would go to heaven muſt do four ſorts of ſervices: Namely hard ſervice, coſtly ſervice, derided ſervice, and forlorn ſervice; upon the laſt he did (as I thought) begin to put me to queſtion whether I was ſuch a one as was ſingular, or did walk in that way wherein few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt walked, or had performed any of thoſe ſervices, and the more I examined my ſelf, the more I was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced I had not, which began to diſquiet me much, and made me go into private, where in darkneſs I ſtruggled not knowing what to do and was aſhamed to inquire, having never yet read ſeriouſly any part of the holy Scripture nor any other Godly book, nor never pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed privately except by book, and forms, and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally without underſtanding ſenſe, faith or the ſpirit of ſupplication, for which things I began to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, but yet knew not what courſe to take, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to caſt my ſelf down before God on my knees, and acknowledge I was in ſuch eſtate I knew not what to do, unleſs he would direct and help me, being much diſcouraged by my own weakneſs and ignorance; then by a choice providence I came to find a book writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Doctor <hi>Sibbes,</hi> called the bruiſed Reed, and by reading that I found there was incouragement for weak ones, and ſuch who had but a ſmoak of true deſire though the fire of grace did not appear in them, yet ſtill I was like one groping in the dark, till God ſent a moſt holy ſober mortified Chriſtian to me, who ſeeing me like a Char-coal that had been in the fire, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light and life, he pittied my condition, and began to tell me, what a hard work the work of converſion was, it being no leſs then to make a ſtone fleſh, and darkneſs light; theſe with many ſuch words began to ſink and to enter deep into my heart, and from that time I took up the profeſſion of Godlineſs although
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43443:7"/>
the foundation work was not laid deep enough, ſo as to have the heart mortified for, or from ſin, but I was diſquieted within me, and like a Boat toſſed upon the waves, that could make to no ſhore for ſafety.</p>
            <p>At this time the Lord viſited me with a very ſore and great pain of the Tooth-ach, which continued divers days and nights together, in great extremity, ſo that with the violence thereof, I thought I ſhould have been deprived of my ſenſes, or life; and by another good providence, I met with a little book of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and in that, with this expreſſion, if the pains of one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bone, or tooth, be ſo grievous for a few days, what then will the pains of the whole body and ſoul be in hell for evermore? Upon this my terrour began in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that degree, that it made the other pain to ſeem ſomewhat more eaſie, and both together, put me upon crying out to God with greater ſenſe then before, and between fear and pain, a troubled muddy ſpirit of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer began to ſpring up, and perceiving I had ſome help, I pumped harder, and ſo found at laſt my heart began to be inlarged with confeſſions, and my ſins were brought into remembrance, for which I arraigned my ſelf, and lay in my own thoughts as a convicted and guilty perſon; but all the while I knew not how, or by whom to become guiltleſs, or to attain pardon, all this while I never looked on the Scripture, nay, I laid aſide that book called the bruiſed Reed, as too good for me to read, and wherein I could expect no comfort.</p>
            <p>But very ſhortly after, hearing of another very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous godly Preacher, I reſolved to go hear him, he Preached that day upon <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go and Preach the Goſpel to every creature, He that believes and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Out of which words he ſhewed, that as the Goſpel was to be Preached to every creature, ſo none could be ſaved but ſuch as did believe in Chriſt, which afterwards, by comparing it with <hi>John</hi> 1:12. He
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43443:7"/>
ſhewed that it was to receive Chriſt, and thereupon he encouraged all to receive Chriſt, becauſe he would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all their wants, ſtrengthen them under all their weakneſſes, ſuccour them againſt all their temptations and the like; upon the urging of which motives, I was much encouraged and perſwaded to be willing to receive and take Chriſt upon his own termes; but then he ſhewed that they who would have Chriſt and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him, muſt do the hardeſt, learn the harſheſt part with the ſweeteſt, and ſuffer the ſoreſt things; which words being ſutable to thoſe that wrought the firſt conviction upon me by another, they were ſo much the more obſervable, and as a ſecond wedge clave my heart ſomewhat more, made deeper entrance, and cauſed further reſolutions in me to ſeek to perform thoſe particulars, and to that end I began to read the Bible, to pray often in private, and to hear the ſtricteſt Preachers, and to leave off my old Companions, and to chuſe others who profeſſed Religion, with whom I went to private and publick faſts, held Chriſtian conferences, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Upon further hearing concerning the old heart and body of corruption and that every man had ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and beloved ſin, and that there was a neceſſity of having the heart changed, and corruption mortified, and ſubdued, the Lord ſhewed me hereby the ſad, and loſt Eſtate my ſoul was in for want thereof; and now the work of compunction, and contrition began in me with many deep ſighs and bitter tears, ſelf-loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſelf-abaſing, confeſſing of former ſins, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, and judgeing my ſelf for them, and ſtriving againſt them, and ſeeking to kill them by long abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from Meat, by much watchfulneſs, by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold water onely, many Months together, by ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up myſelf to eat ſo many bits of Meat, (and that of the courſeſt ſort too) at every meal (ſome times
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43443:8"/>
ſix, ſome times eight, and twelve was a great meal with me) and by this means I thought to overcome the Fleſh, and flying ſometimes to the holy command of God againſt ſin, by which I found no other relief than a School-boy doth, who complains to his Maſter againſt the hardneſs of his Leſſon: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9, for the Commandement came, ſtirred and revived ſin, and ſo I began to dye and deſpair; the Law telling me I was a condemned ſinner, the juſtice and terrours of God did ſeize upon my Conſcience, and the ſpirit of fear and bondage (as the fruit of the Law, and an effect of Gods wrath) did bind me like a Priſoner, to anſwer every breach of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. Not leading me to Chriſt, but reſtraining me from him, and ſhutting me up in unbelief. And when ſometimes through energy and earneſtneſs of ſpirit in Prayer, I called God Father, had checks upon my Conſcience for my over-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and preſumption; and to pacifie and ſilence this charge, I was forced to confeſs my ſin of misbelief, or falſe faith, and watch my tongue from uttering any ſuch boldneſs for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Thus finding no relief from the Law, or command of God, but the threats and Judgements thereof, ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whipping, and wounding my ſoul, I looked out for ſome ſuitable promiſe not any promiſe of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of Sanctification, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.18. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.19. <hi>That God would give a new heart, and would ſubdue Iniquities.</hi> So I fell a praying over theſe, and the like promiſes; but finding no anſwer of prayer, my heart no more ſanctified, nor my corruptions ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. The next work (at the inſtigation of Satan) was to conclude that I had no right to any promiſe, being out of Chriſt, and that all my prayers were an abomination to God: and ſo I began to queſtion whether it was beſt for me to continue in prayer or to forbear. But I was not long under that temptation:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43443:8"/>
conſidering that prayer was a moral duty, and to be performed by all; and that the ſin of, or in a duty, ſhould not make a man neglect his duty: for upon the ſame account a man muſt leave plowing, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>the Plowing of the wicked is ſin, Prov.</hi> 21.4. Hereupon I purpoſed to be more diligent to get into Chriſt, and to have a new heart, that ſo I might perform my duty acceptably; I alſo reſolved to prepare my ſelf more for prayer, to ſearch and keep my heart more carefully, and cloſly in my duty to God; and if vain thoughts, hardneſs, or ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did prevaile, then after the duty, I had (as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.2.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſin, or my conſcience ſmiting, condemning, and diſquieting me, ſending, and driving me to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er again immediately, it may be twice, thrice, or oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner together; yea making me often times to riſe out of my bed ſeveral times in a night, and forcing me on my bare knees on the cold floor, as if that had been more pleaſing to God: But all this being done in my own ſtrength, under a covenant of works, and to work a ſelf righteouſneſs (both to pleaſe God, and to pacifie my own conſcience) as it was unacceptable to God, ſo unprofitable to me.</p>
            <p>Then hearing that Chriſt was ſent from, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by God his Father to ſinners; I thought of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, but durſt not, through a miſtake in the meaning of ſome Scriptures, as that invitation of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden:</hi> and thoſe words, <hi>Luke</hi> 19 10. <hi>I came to ſeek, and to ſave that which was loſt:</hi> from whence I concluded, that none were invited by Chriſt, but thoſe that are weary and heavy laden, and ſuch as ſee and feel their loſt condition, whereas it is meant, that they in an eſpecial manner are invited. I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I was not yet fit nor qualified for Chriſt, but muſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43443:9"/>
have a precious work wrought in me, to that end I ſuppoſed a greater and clearer ſight of ſin was needful therefore I often and earneſtly prayed, that God would perform that promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They ſhall loath themſelves for the evil they have committed in all their Abominations:</hi> Yea, I deſired (though not underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what I ſaid) that God would let Satan appear in ſome ſhape to terrifie me, that by that means I might ſee my danger, ſo much the more to induce me to fly to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Satan took advantage and opportunity, and as he did formerly to <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo he appeared ſeveral times, and in ſeveral wayes to me: as once like a houſe, ſtood directly in my way, with which ſight I fell upon my face as dead, and after a while crying unto the Lord <hi>I</hi> had a little ſtrength by which <hi>I</hi> was enabled to go home, but was thereupon ſick ſeveral dayes after: Another time, being alone in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, late at night at Prayer, and the door ſhut, <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Prayer till the Candle went out, and as <hi>I</hi> went on, <hi>I</hi> ſenſibly perceived a ſtrong cold wind to blow, my hair was like to <hi>Eliphaz, Job</hi> 4.14, 15. and had the ſame effect, for it made the hair of my fleſh to ſtand up, and cauſed all my bones to ſhake, and on the ſuddain <hi>I</hi> heard one walk about me, tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the Chamber floor, as if it had been ſome heavie big man, upon which <hi>I</hi> grew ſo fearful, and unbelieving, that <hi>I</hi> ran down ſhutting, and haſping the door after me, and called up ſome of the family, telling them there was a thief in the room, but it proved in the end, to be no other than that ſpiritual thief, and murderer Satan, who did both then, and at ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times greatly affright and terrifie me, not onely by his ſecret workings in the conſcience, but by viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble repreſentations, and outwardly real apparitions: At this time and long after, he alſo ſhewed me my ſins,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43443:9"/>
in their number, and nature, to be ſuch, and ſo many as that there was no pardon for them, and therefore tempted me oft, and divers wayes to deſtroy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Sometimes by caſting my ſelf into a River to drown my ſelf, whither he brought me, and whilſt I reaſoned the caſe with him, this was frequently his motive to me, the fewer ſins I committed in this world, and the ſhorter time I lived in it, the leſs would be my torment: He often tempted me alſo, to deſtroy my ſelf with a knife, ſo that I was often neceſſitated to fling it out of my hand when I was at meat alone in my Chamber, &amp; to riſe from my meat for fear, ſo that I durſt not for ſome time carry a Knife with me: But when the Lord did relieve ſometimes by one means, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by another, I was ſtrengthned with this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God ſhould do what he would with me, for I would never do as <hi>Judas</hi> did, deſtroy myſelf. When Satan ſaw that he was diſappointed in that temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then he told me that I was a Reprobate, and let me profeſs what I would, my Damnation was ſure, and my hypocriſie, and ſinnes under profeſſion, would be worſe than any other ſinnes, and therefore it were better of the two, to lay down my profeſſion and the duties thereof, to that temptation the Lord helped me to anſwer him thus: That whilſt I lived in ſcandalous ſins he never thus tempted me, and I was reſolved, if I knew God would Damn me, yet to have as few ſins as I could to anſwer for hereafter.</p>
            <p>When theſe temptations failed, then he began to raiſe up Perſecution againſt me; as one day going through the Town where I was born, from <hi>Kingſton</hi> to <hi>Lanvaire-waterdine</hi> I met with two Gentlemen Kinſmen of mine (in their drunkenneſs) who called' upon me to come to them, and without any the leaſt provoking word, or carriage, they fell both upon me, and one of them with a Crab-tree Cudgel woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43443:10"/>
me ſore, and their pretence was, I had reproved them for ſinne, but God raiſed me up, and gave me a heart freely to forgive them.</p>
            <p>Another time, four men laid wait in a ſecret place, as I went upon a Lords day in a morning to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, with ſeveral weapons, being all of them, as was confeſſeed by one of them afterwards, under a vow to kill me: but God by his providence preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, in ſending two Strangers unexpected to help, who, riding before diſcovered them, wherupon they fled; yet vented their malice upon ſome other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whom they wounded: But one of them that day came to a Meeting, and in hearing of me was ſo convinced of his ſinne, that he was ſeen, and heard publickly to repent for what he had done, and never after was known to perſecute any. Another time a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked man entered into an Oath, that when ever he met with me, he would kill me; he waited his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, dwelling near me, ſeveral times to do it, and one Lords day he went to the place where I preached, with a full intention, either at my going, or retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning home, to execute his purpoſe; but being at the Sermon, and hearing Chriſt ſo freely offered to ſinners, the word did ſo affect him, that he wept, ſaying, within himſelf, what a villain am I to intend evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a man? And the next day in the morning very early, he came to the houſe where I lodged, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſpeak with me in private, and with tears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed this to me, and deſired me to pardon him, and pray for him, and ever after was very friendly to me.</p>
            <p>Another time being in <hi>Brecknock-ſhire</hi> at an honeſt mans houſe, I preached to ſeveral that were then toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; my Text was in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.16. from which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>That though the little Flock of Chriſt be deſpiſed, and diſperſed; yet they ſhall be gathered, priſed, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43443:10"/>
preſerved.</hi> As I was handling this Doctrine, about twelve or ſixteen luſty rude Royſters broke into the houſe, and did ſeveral times attempt to offer violence to my ſelf, and to the reſt of the Brethren with me, but it pleaſed God to reſtrain them; at length, by the procurement of Mr. <hi>Hugh Floyd</hi> (the High She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff for the year) I was bound over to the Seſſions, and an indictment preferr'd againſt me; wherein I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed firſt for drawing away the Kings Subjects: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for ſpeaking againſt the Book of Common-Prayer: Thirdly, for Sacrilege: Which laſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was grounded upon the drawing down of a Meeting-houſe door, by me and the Church-Wardens, that the people which came in a great croud, might hear with the better convenience; but the Lord did ſo own his own Cauſe, and me the unworthieſt of his Servants, that I was then delivered alſo. Yet finding the perſecution ſo hot againſt me, that I could not be permitted to ſerve the Lord there, I did by the advice of my Brethren, leave my Native Countrey of <hi>Wales,</hi> and by the guidance and providence of God, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and conducted ſafely to <hi>London,</hi> where I arrived in <hi>Auguſt, Anno</hi> 1642.</p>
            <p>Another time, as I was preaching upon the ſide of a Hill (being denyed leave in a publick place) a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Royſters came with ſwords, ſlaves, and fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-pieces; and after ſome oppoſition, one of them cryed down with him, down with him; but the Lord ſtirred up ſome of the people to preſerve me, and prevent them.</p>
            <p>Another time a wicked Butcher, who had long threatned me, laying wait as it ſeems for me, he one night ſtood in a narrow paſſage, through which I was to come, with a great Clubb, but his blow falling ſhort of me by the protection of God I eſcaped his hands.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:43443:11"/>During my abode in <hi>London,</hi> where I continued Preaching for above two years, I had great experience of Gods goodneſs in providing for me, and in ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Miniſtry to the ſpiritual good, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of many, but the greateſt of all my mercies, ſince my converſion, are as follows, concerning the time and manner of my obtaining aſſurance.</p>
            <p>After I had been about four years in conſtant doubts and great fears, as to my eternal condition, being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times tempted by Satan to deſtroy my ſelf; and Preaching alſo to others ſhaking and terrifying Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, particularly out of <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. <hi>Take heed leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, that to ſuch as did believe in Chriſt, there was a certaintie of Salvation. My underſtanding being cleared in theſe two particulars; I was then to ſeek and to learn whether I did believe or not, and to know that I examined my ſelf, what ſigns of true Faith I had, and how I could prove that I did believe; and finding no certain evidence, being alſo convinced that I had before, many years, gone in that way to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I continued ſtill in an hopeleſs ſtate: but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſuddain, and unexpectedly, a mighty power, no leſs than that ſpirit which raiſed up Chriſt Jeſus from the dead, and which declared him to be the Sonne of God, did enable me to believe, and witneſſed effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in me that I did believe: Which divine impreſſion, I look upon to be all one with that ſealing ſpoken of in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>And the witneſſing of the Spirit of God with our Spirits.

               </gap> taught by the Lord to preach in another manner than before. Namely, to lay Chriſt as the foundation, and to Preach chiefly and mainly, and qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and duties in a ſecondary and ſubſervant way: Yet from hence alſo did Satan take occaſion to thruſt at me; and throw me into the other extream, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, which is truly, and properly called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomianiſme,</hi> to deſtroy, and utterly deny the uſe of the Law: but the Lord did timely, and gracioſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my fall in this alſo, and to fulfil unto me that Scripture, <hi>He that fears the Lord ſhall come out of all. viz.</hi> out of all extreams, as the foregoing words do ſhew. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.18.</p>
            <p>To omit many other remarkable providences of God towards me for the ſpace of two years that I was in <hi>London,</hi> as alſo his goodneſs to me for ſome ſpace that I was in the Army, I was at length called to <hi>Dartford</hi> in <hi>Kent:</hi> where, indeed Gods favours of ſeveral kinds for the ſpace of two years and an half, were very many, as to own ſuch a nothing Creature, and enable me to bring home in that Town, and thereabouts (I hope to Gods glory I may ſpeak it) many ſouls to Chriſt: where alſo I gathered a Congregation among whom, I had very ſweet and comfortable Society.</p>
            <p>After ſome time of my abode there, it pleaſed the Lord to viſit that Town with the Plague, where, about thirty Houſes were ſhut up at once, and the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were carried by my Chamber wall, and window; yet it pleaſed God to preſerve me and my Family wonderfully from the Diſeaſe, although I continued in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43443:12"/>
the Town, and preached conſtantly three times a week, and ſome that had the Sickneſs upon them, came publickly to hear; After which, the Lord ſtayed the Plague, and delivered me from that affliction alſo.</p>
            <p>Yet not long after this, it pleaſed the Lord to viſit me with a very dangerous Feaver and Ague, inſomuch as I was in the eyes of all my Friends, and in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Phyſicians alſo hopeleſs as to Life; yet God gave me Faith to be healed by that means preſcribed, <hi>James</hi> 5. And I ſent unto ſome Godly Preachers in <hi>London,</hi> deſiring them to come unto me, and perform that duty of anointing me with Oyl: And whilſt I was waiting for, and expecting their anſwer, and queſtioning whether they would have Faith, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to practice the ſame; the Lord brought that Scripture to my remembrance, and fixed it upon me, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Shall unbelief make the Faith of God of none effect?</hi> or ſhall they as it was then applyed to me, make void the Faith that God hath given me, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me of being healed? wherupon I was confirmed that it ſhould not, but I did believe that God would recover me, and accordingly, after a ſuddain and ſtrange trance which I fell into, and continued in for about ſix hours, wherin I did ſweat abundantly, yet diſcerned not at all, during that time, how it was with me, or what was done for me, my ſickneſs preſently abated, and I recovered.</p>
            <p>Having ſpent above two years at <hi>Dartford,</hi> and being now upon my return home into <hi>Wales,</hi> I was willing to take along with me a Certificate, or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial from the Synod which ſate then, and had the tryal of all Publick Preachers. To this purpoſe I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed my ſelf to ſome of them, to whom Mr. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Marſhal</hi> was one, they queſtioned me about Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and told me, that unleſs I would be Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>About the year 1647. the Iſland of <hi>Angleſey</hi> in North <hi>Wales,</hi> being then un-reduced, the Parliament Forces went to reduce it, and their chief Officers ſent for me to Preach unto that brigade of Souldiers, and as I marched with them unto the place, either the night immediately before, or the night before that, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto me in my ſleep, that I ſhould be wounded, and two of my friends cut (and the very fingers were pointed out) which accordingly came to paſs, yet when I was in extream danger between ſeveral ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who fell upon me, receiving that and ſome other wounds: there being no likelyhood to eſcape, I heard a voyce as I apprehended ſpeaking audibly to me, I have choſen thee to preach rhe Goſpel, to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, O Lord then bring me off; and immediately God guided my Horſe (though he was very wild, and not well commanded) to go backward out of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricado that I had entred at, and ſo I was indeed mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly preſerved, although a good man a Captain who came to relieve me was killed cloſe to me, and as far as I could perceive the ſame Bullet that was ſhot at me took him in the neck and killed him.</p>
            <p>Many other remarkable circumſtances there are in this deliverance which I here omit.</p>
            <p>Several other times alſo I have been delivered from perils by water, by Thieves, by Enemies purpoſely lying in wait for me, who yet had no power to hurt me, the Lord converted ſome, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43443:14"/>
prevented and terrified others from their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not forget the favour of the Lord in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering prayer, of which the moſt remarkable inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are theſe.</p>
            <p>One time coming from Preaching I loſt my way, and being out till it was far in the night in a Wood or Forreſt, among Lakes, Bryars and Thorns, I went up and down while I was quite weary, but by looking up to the Lord, I was preſently directed into my way. The like experience I had another time, when another Preacher and my ſelf had loſt our way in a very dark night, and had tired our ſelves in ſearching to and fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to no purpoſe, at laſt calling to mind how God had formerly heard in that caſe when I ſought unto him, we called upon the Lord, who immediately pointed out our way, and it ſeemed as clear to us as if it had been day light.</p>
            <p>One Miſtreſs <hi>Watkins</hi> of the Pariſh of <hi>Lanniggn</hi> in the County of <hi>Brecknock,</hi> a gracious Gentlewoman, having kept her chamber and bed as was reported for two years, and not gone from home for the ſpace of four years, hearing that <hi>I</hi> was come into thoſe parts ſent for me to come and viſit her, ſhe having it ſeems ſome faith, that if I prayed for her ſhe ſhould be healed, that the next morning ſhe went between two and three miles on foot to hear me preach.</p>
            <p>Another time one <hi>Elizabeth Morris</hi> of new <hi>Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> (a Religious Maid) having the Falling ſickneſs or Convulſion Fits, which took her many times in one day, one night being at Family-Duty in a Brothers houſe in Town, whilſt I was ſpeaking ſhe fell into one of her Fits, but Prayer being made for her ſhe recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the prayer was ended, and for many years had no more fits, and I think hath not been troubled at all ſince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:43443:14"/>Another time, <hi>viz.</hi> (Oliver Protect. days) there was mighty wet Harveſt, which continued ſeveral weeks, inſomuch that much Hay and Corn was ſpoiled, but divers Chriſtians that were diſſatisfied with that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, having met ſeveral days to ſeek advice about it, came at laſt to draw up a Paper or Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: And the day being come when we intended to ſubſcribe it. After ſpending ſome time further to ſeek the Lord, it being a great rain, ſo that it did beat in through the glaſs windows into the room where we met, one that was cloſe to the window, being to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the duty, earneſtly begged of God that if he did approve of the work we were about, and would have us to proceed therein, he would be pleaſed to grant us a ſign of fair weather preſently, and before Prayer was ended, the Lord ſhut up the windows of Heaven, and the Sun did ſhine gloriouſly, and ſome if not all of us did obſerve that for divers weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afterwards we had exceeding fair weather, and ſo had two mercies given us at once.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(The Paper thus ſubſcribed, was called a Word for God, or a Teſtimony on truths behalf from ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and divers hundreds of Chriſtians in</hi> Wales, <hi>(and ſome few adjacent) againſt wickedneſs in high places, with a brief Letter to the Lord Gen.</hi> Cromwell, <hi>and both preſented to his hands, and afterward publiſhed in Print.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe few things of many which I have obſerved in my ſelf, concerning the Lords gracious and wonderful dealing with me, I have ſet down, not as boaſting or ſeeking praiſe to my ſelf, but to keep a memorial of the Lords benefits, and to ſtir up others, into whoſe hands theſe few notes may come, to have confidence in the power and goodneſs of God who is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of them that believe in him.</p>

               </gap> the <hi>Prophets, Evangeliſts,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (commonly called the <hi>Bible</hi>) are the <hi>Written word of God;</hi> which (beſides the plain Teſtimony of Scripture, in many places thus witneſſing of it ſelf) doth moſt fully and convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, by conſidering that what in <hi>Matthew</hi> is called the <hi>command, Mat.</hi> 15.6. That in <hi>Mark</hi> is ſtiled, <hi>The word of God, Mark</hi> 7.13. and the like may be obſerved, in comparing <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, 14. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. where the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Afflictions are Chriſts Love Tokens,</hi> Jer. 12.7. Heb. 12.6. Rev. 3.9. and Chriſtians are never more tendred, then when moſt afflicted, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> Jer. 31.20</p>
            <p>A Chriſtians Soul ſhould be like the Dial going according to the Sun, or following Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Small ſins yeilded too, make way for greater, and one ſin for another.</p>
            <p>He that converts a Sinner covers a world (or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude) of ſins, and gains more then a World, to wit a Soul.</p>

            <p>Be not ambitions of Love, and thou ſhalt not be ſo ſoon an object of Envy.</p>
            <p>It is good to curb natural and acquired Gifts, but to give the Reins to Grace, and let alwayes Grace lead rule and maſter Gifts.</p>
            <p>A Heart unconverted is contended with nothing but what is helping it unto Hell, and it hath never enough of that very ſin, and the Heart converted is never ſatisfied but with what helps it towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet thinks he hath never enough thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt and Grace.</p>
            <p>Welcome thou (thy Landlord) Chriſt into thy Cottage now, and he will welcome thee into thy Palace hereafter.</p>
            <p>Get Chriſt (and Chriſtian) to bind thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the peace, and thy Affections and Fleſh to the good behaviour.</p>
            <p>Spend all thy Grace againſt thy Luſt, but none for it.</p>
            <p>Thy hardeſt duty in Chriſtianity is to deny ſelf, and to deſtroy ſin.</p>

            <p>It is a ſpecial favour, and great promotion to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Satan accuſeth God to Men, and Men to God, but Chriſt excuſes and anſwers all his accuſations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his People.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians ſhould do as the <hi>Shechemites</hi> did, when their City (their own Souls in ſtrength) was beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down fly to their Tower even Chriſt.</p>

            <p>Retiredneſs and cloſe impriſonment drives a man to hold cloſer Communion with God, and to a ſtricter ſearch of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Take heed that preparatory meditation (to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) doth not prevent Prayer it ſelf, or put you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Prayer.</p>
            <p>One of the radical ſins ſpoken of, (1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.16. <hi>Is every mans maſter ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I often found my heart in dayes of Humiliation, more affected and melted by the Prayer of weaker then ſtronger Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>I would be glad to be out of the World when I have no ſervice to do for God in it.</p>
            <p>He that would live for himſelf (onely or cheifly) in the World is not worthy to live a day in it.</p>
            <p>If I may have liberty to ſerve Chriſt, I would have the glory to ſuffer for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secret Prayer is either a familiar ſpeaking to God, or with God, or a pouring out of the Heart before God, through his Son our Saviour by his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Ejaculations, or ſhort and ſudden Pantings, and breathings out of deſires to God, may be more acceptable to him and prevailing with him, then long Prayers.</p>
            <p>There may be great difference between the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a Chriſtian one time and another, yea in the exerciſing of his Gifts in Praying, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>It is happy to dye in the Lord, and honourable to dye for the Lord.</p>
            <p>Sins do dye and fall off from Chriſtians as the Leaves fall from Trees in Autumn by degrees.</p>

               <hi>Chriſtians are now as</hi> Abraham <hi>was driven out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and come where they were before or into their firſt State, therefore they ſhould offer to the Lord, as he did,</hi> Gen. 13.3.4.</p>
            <p>God is now ſpoiling us, of what would otherwiſe have ſpoiled us.</p>
            <p>Churches gathered in proſperity, will hardly ſtand or continue together in adverſity.</p>
            <p>A Child of God may know the weight of ſin by Chriſts ſufferings, for if that ſtrong Heart of Steel, did bend under the weight of our ſins, what ſhall poor weak men do which is but a Reed or Ruſh.</p>
            <p>As our good works and performances ſhould have an operation upon our Souls and Hearts, to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Faith, ſo ſhould our weakneſſes and ſins to work repentance.</p>
            <p>It is a great condeſcention in God to afflict or lay his hand upon man, and in that ſence the Apoſtle exhorts Beleivers not to diſpiſe or think little of the chaſtning of the Lord. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3.</p>
            <p>A Beleiver is to ſhut the Eye of Reaſon, if he will clearly ſee with the Eye of Faith.</p>
            <p>The promiſe is a Chriſtian perſpective, and his Faith the Eye with which he looks through it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt and God the Father in him.</p>
            <p>A Priſon or perſecution is to a Chriſtian as ſome ſcaring thing, that one ſees in the Night at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43443:36"/>
but when he comes near it, and to know it, he is not at all afraid of it.</p>
            <p>Seek to find out your own Errors, before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find them out, and to write your own Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata's.</p>
            <p>VVhen the Lord is trying his People, they ſhould be trying themſelves.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians ſhould not deſire deliverance before the time appointed, for that is as if a VVoman ſhould deſire to have her Child born before the full and due time.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians are apt to feel, and fear puniſhment more then ſin, which is the cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>Gods People muſt expect in the VVorld, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of Strangers.</p>
            <p>Sins in Saints are like Weeds weeded out of a Garden, or Field which lye in the Alleys, or Veins, but never grow there again.</p>
            <p>A Hypocrite is like a white Stone in the Water amongſt other Stones, and of that ſame nature with other Stones there, hard, heavy, cold, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexable and differs only in colour.</p>
            <p>A true Chriſtian is like a Flint-ſtone which though it falls into Water, yet it keeps, and retains Fire in it ſtill: ſo doth he retain his Grace, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his corruption.</p>
            <p>Labour to act thoſe graces cheifly that are moſt contrary to your maſter ſins and cheif corruptions.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath Saints enough to devide into three bodies, ſome to ſuffer for him, ſome to deſtroy <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi> and ſome to be for Seed-Corn, to ſow again in the Earth.</p>
            <p>Learn by lighter Croſſes to look and prepare for heavier.</p>
            <p>In two Caſes tis hard to Act Faith. 1. When there is nothing ſenſible or viſible to ſecond, and

ſupport it, or 2. when there is very much to fil the outward ſenſes.</p>
            <p>It is a very common and ordinary thing for moſt or all Profeſſors, to be in one or two extreams, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to over value, or under value Inſtruments, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>The more Saints do beleive and ſuffer, the more they may expect of the ſpirit. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14.</p>
            <p>Be more thoughtful and careful how to uſe what you have, to Gods glory, then to gain more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord freely gives, and justly takes away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The exerciſing of Graces do naturally deſtroy ſin, and the more you abound in Acts of Grace the more you increaſe the habit <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.26.</p>
            <p>The Law cauſeth ſickneſs of Soul, but the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel healeth the ſame.</p>
            <p>When Saints perceive their ſins growing weak they ſhould then proſecute them moſt.</p>
            <p>A Saint is to put forth his Faith in Prayer, and afterwards follow his Prayer with Faith.</p>
            <p>In the mideſt of earthly buſineſs, the Soul ſhould redeem ſome ſpecial time for ſecret, and private duties.</p>
            <p>It is the will of Chriſt that Saints ſhould rejoyce more in what Chriſt hath done for them, then in what they have done, or can do for him.</p>
            <p>Learn to obſerve what God gives without asking, and what he gives in anſwer to Prayer for the one begets Thankfulneſs, the other more Prayer.</p>
            <p>Chriſt kept the Law legally, Beleivers kept it E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelically, he perfectly, they purpoſingly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouringly.</p>
            <p>A Beleivers aſſurance and cheifeſt joy, doth not ariſe from his ſanctification (becauſe that is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect here in degrees) but from his juſtification <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:43443:37"/>Look upon Chriſt firſt without you, then ſearch for him within you.</p>
            <p>God makes us feel him (or his hand) that he may hear us, ſtrokes makes Crys, and Whipings, mornful complaints to him.</p>
            <p>God troubles us, that we may turn to him, and leaves us a while for to ſee whether we will follow after him.</p>
            <p>Its ſtrange and very bad ſign to ſee Saints look more upon the ſins of the wicked to ripen them for miſery, then after ſelf humiliation and holineſs to ripen, and fit themſelves for mercy.</p>
            <p>He that cannot pitty the ſinner, and hate ſin, doth not reprove, out of love to Chriſt nor from a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirit.</p>
            <p>He that loves not a Reprover, and prizes not his reproof neither profits thereby, is more his ſins, then his Souls friend.</p>
            <p>If God hath kept thee from falling ſtill, fear, watch, pray, and live by Faith on Chriſt.</p>
            <p>No power can keep him in Bonds, whom truth and innocency acquits.</p>
            <p>Due end in being in the world, is not to be to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Though the People of God may be killed, yet they can neither be hurt nor overcome.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians though diſagreeing in Opinion ſhould agree in Affection, and differing in Controverſie, ſhould agree in Charity.</p>
            <p>It is a very ſad thing neither to be careful to do well, nor repent of doing ill.</p>
            <p>The Portion that Chriſt gives us is not near ſo bitter, as his Cordial is ſweet.</p>
            <p>The fear of death is ingrafted in the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all men, but Faith works it out by Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Nothing will be terrible where the love of God
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43443:37"/>
is apprehended, and nothing greivous where love to Chriſt is exerciſed.</p>
            <p>Learn to prefer Chriſt before ſelf, and ſuffering above ſinning.</p>
            <p>Look for ſuffering as for Exaltation, for it is an honour to be accounted worthy, and a double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be enabled and carried through ſafety.</p>

               <p>This day was a very comfortable day to me in the morning, <hi>I</hi> was refreſhed by thoſe words 31. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15. <hi>My times are in thy hands,</hi> &amp;c. by comparing that with <hi>Ier.</hi> 20.12. <hi>I</hi> had much comfort in the ſociety of Gods People, and ſeveral times in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that day, and power againſt evil thoughts, yet that Evening <hi>I</hi> was aſſaulted ſtrongly with ſinful thoughts, but in my flying to God in prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them they fled from me.</p>
               <p>This day being the Lords day, <hi>I</hi> had ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Lord in private Prayer, and a greater ſence of the ſufferings of his People upon my Heart, and it came into my Heart to aske ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly of God, that <hi>I</hi> might love him better then my Life, and better then my Luſts, remembring that Scripture in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2.5. That Self-love, and loving of pleaſure more then God will be the two cheif Characters of Hyppocrites and Appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, in the latter dayes.</p>
               <p>In the Evening <hi>I</hi> was again aſſaulted with Evil thoughts, which neceſſitated me to fly to the Lord in Prayer, and thence <hi>I</hi> learned this Leſſon, that ſometimes the very ſin of a Chriſtian drives him to his Duty and Service, ſometimes by way of prevention either to the Scriptures, for ſome word of promiſe or command againſt ſin, or to Prayer, and ſometimes after a Soul hath ſinned, it ſees a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſpeedily and earneſtly to confeſs it, repent for it, reſolve and watch againſt it.</p>

To get my Soul more ſetled in the aſſurance and apprehenſion of ſalvation. 2. More ſenſible of my own, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſins, and my own and other mens ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. 3. More humbled for my unprofitableneſs in my impriſonment. 4. More willing to dye, and more mindful of death.</p>
               <p>This day <hi>I</hi> received and unexpected mercy, and was prevented from a temptation, which made my heart rejoyce, and preventing grace eſpecially that which prevented from ſin, have been frequently cauſe of rejoycing to me.</p>
               <p>This day <hi>I</hi> had little change in the frame of my Spirit either to good or Evil, but ſome ſence <hi>I</hi> had of my own weakneſs, yet <hi>I</hi> had ſome comfort from thoſe words <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.17. but <hi>I</hi> am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh on me, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.8. Yet the Lord will command his loving kindneſs, and his Song ſhall be with me and my Prayer unto the God of my life.</p>
               <p>This day <hi>I</hi> had a good and comfortable day to my Soul eſpecially in Prayer, Four things <hi>I</hi> ſaw cauſe to be humbled for, Firſt, that <hi>I</hi> had not more ſence of the ſins, and ſufferings of Gods People or of my own. Secondly, That the Works, Glory,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43443:44"/>
Wayes, Ordinances &amp; People of the Lord are in ſuch Contempt. Thirdly, that there is no more Stability, Zeal and Courage in the Saints for good, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Evil.

Secondly, Preparation for ſufferings.</p>
               <p>This day I was much troubled for hearing one ſweare ſeveral Oaths, and not reproving him for the ſame and convinced alſo from, Pſal. 50.7. <hi>Hear O</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>and I will testifie againſt thee I am God even thy God,</hi> that God had many things againſt me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and I was convinced providencially of one cauſe of my ſufferings. Being a day to ſeek the Lord in private Prayer, I had my Heart ſomewhat ſoftned and yet I was troubled it continued ſo hard, and I learned from the, 2. <hi>Cro.</hi> 6.37. That I ſhould in this my ſuffering bethink my ſelf both what I was, and what I had done, that I ſhould pray more earneſtly, and turn more throughly and perfectly unto the Lord, and that Evening <hi>I</hi> could and did pray, moſt heartily for my Enemies, and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</p>
               <p>This day being the Lords day, <hi>I</hi> had ſeveral times refreſhings from the Lord in Prayer, and in ſpeaking his word, and that word in <hi>Iob.</hi> 10.14.

The ſame day <hi>I</hi> had a conſideration of the great evil of ſinning againſt the Lord after

aſſurance. This day <hi>I</hi> obſerved theſe words. Pſal. 59.3. <hi>For loe they lye in wait (Davids</hi> Enemies) <hi>for my Soul, the mighty are gathered againſt me not for my transgreſſion nor for my ſin O Lord I</hi> could truely and with comfort ſay that mine Enemies did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute me, but not for my ſin, or transgreſſion which is a comfort to me this day alſo by a ſpecial providence, God brought a dear Friend who praying wit me, my Heart was much affected, and melted.</p>
               <p>This day in the morning my Heart was very free to pray for my Perſecutors, and Enemies as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really is <hi>I</hi> was to ſeek and receive pardon for my own ſins, <hi>I</hi> had power alſo to apply thoſe words to my ſelf. Pſal. 62.2. <hi>He is onely my Rock and my Salvation, he is my defence I ſhall not greatly by moved,</hi> and in verſe 6. <hi>I ſhall not be moved,</hi> God did bring this Scripture as an Antidote for that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, there came ſeveral perſons one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to tell me that I and ſeveral others were to be tryed at the Seſſions, and <hi>I</hi> obſerved that my Heart was very little moved thereat, but could willingly refer my ſelf to the Lord, and be quiet in, and contented with his will, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo contrary to my own carnal and natural will.</p>
               <p>This Evening in diſcourſeing with a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian antient woman, <hi>I</hi> found by the tenderneſs of Heart the had for ſin and her zeal for God, that ſhe was in a far better temper of Spirit, then I was in which helped on my Humility ſomewhat, this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening alſo I had ſome power to reſiſt Temptation and to check Corruption.</p>
               <p>I had my Heart enlargned and ſoftned in Prayer, and through Gods goodneſs was much freed from Temptations, yet had ſome bodily diſtemper, but <hi>I</hi> judged it very little and light in compariſon of what it might be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:43443:45"/>I experienced the Lords coming in, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Prayer I obſerved that Scripture, Pſal. 68.28. <hi>Thy God hath commanded thy ſtrength, ſtrengthen O God that which thou haſt wrought for us,</hi> yet this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening I was moved to paſſion.</p>
               <p>This day ſpent ſo moſt part in writing Letters for Chriſtian Freinds, at ſome of which my Heart was moved, having a great deſire that they might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Faith, and ſtand faſt in the Lord.</p>
               <p>This day I was affected with ſome ill news I heard, and my heart was moved with pitty towards ſome in affliction, I had ſome comfort from, Pſal. 69. verſe 36.29. <hi>Thoſe whom thou haſt wounded (he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and afflicted) are thoſe whom God hath wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and though poor and ſorrowful yet his ſalvation will ſet them up on high,</hi> but eſpecially from verſe the 32. <hi>Their Hearts ſhall live that ſeek God</hi> and this day in obſerving the Characters which a godly Preacher gives in his Book of thoſe that have their ſins pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they are thoſe that ſeek pardon wait in the uſe of means till they obtain it, they do freely pardon others and they do love God for his pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goodneſs, all which in a meaſure (through free grace) I found in me, alſo Pſal. 71.20. <hi>Thou wilt bring me up again</hi> &amp;c. was very refreſhing to me, This day being the Lords day I had ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of the Sabboth, <hi>as it was a ſign between God and his People.</hi> Exod. 31.13.17. Ezek. 20.12.17. <hi>A ſign of his favour in giving it to them, and of his being in Covenant with them and they with him, if they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved it, and therefore it is called the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> Exod. 31.17. <hi>As Circumſion a ſign of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is called a Covenant.</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>My heart was moved to pray earneſtly againſt ſin,</hi> and thoſe words in Pſal. 72.12 13, 14. <hi>were pretious to me, he ſhall deliver the needy when he cryeth, the poor alſo, and him that hath no helper.</hi>

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:43443:46"/>This day I learned from Pſal. 74.16. <hi>The day is thine, and the night it thine,</hi> that the State of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, Love enough to Chriſt to make me willing to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Repentance enough for Sin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Care enough in Gods ſervice.</p>
               <p>This day I had ſome inlargement in Prayer, I learned alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Prayer is a ſpecial remedy or means to prevent the Soul from ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ordinary ſpiritual Judgments (as hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) go before outward Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is a very ſad ſign as well as a great ſin, to refuſe the Lord and his Counſel, God complains Pſal. 81.11. <hi>That they would not hearken to his Counſels, and that they would none of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had ſome ſence (but trouble for want of more) of the ſufferings of Gods People (in S) and I was encouraged from the following Obſervations and conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt. That the man is bleſt whoſe ſtrength is in the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That when God will return to his People, and bring them back from their captivity, he will forgive their iniquities, cover their ſins, and take away all his wrath,</hi> Pſal. 85.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That ſalvation is nigh to the People of God</hi>

               <p>This day ſuppoſed to be the longeſt in the year I judge it my duty, to be ſtrict in obſerving what glory to God, or good to my Soul, ſuch a long day would produce, 1. In the morning (as the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) I had my Heart drawn out to pray earneſtly againſt temptations eſpecially one, and I obſerved preſently the temptation ſet upon me, but the Lord delivered me from it, and removed it from me, for which my Heart was affected moved and raiſed to praiſe the Lord. 2. I learned that affliction draws out the Heart of the godly much in Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.11.13. 3. I learned that it is not enough for a Chriſtian to do good, but he ſhould carefully endeavour to do the cheifeſt and moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable good. 4. By viſiting ſome of the pooreſt Priſoners, I obſerved this, that ſometimes in doing good, a man may be in danger of receiving evil, or a good diſpoſition may bring a man lyable to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in the morning I had encouragement from Pſal. 91.9.10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt made the Lord, which is my refuge, and there ſhall no evil befat thee,</hi> I had much refreſhing alſo in the communion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Chriſtians, I learned alſo from <hi>Revelations</hi> the 2.26.27. compared with the 12. Chap. 11. <hi>That he that ſuffereth for Chriſt overcometh,</hi> ferendo vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſpero, at the noiſe of the great thunder this night I was moved to conſider the greatneſs of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> whoſe voice was ſo loud.</p>
               <p>I was troubled in the morning with many bad thoughts, yet had ſome trouble for them but out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.4.10.24. I obſerved three things, 1. That the heart may be withered, 2. That after God hath lifted up a Saint he may caſt him down again, 3. That <hi>Davids</hi> argument to move God not to cut

him off in the mideſt of his dayes, was becauſe Gods years were throughout all Generations.</p>
               <p>Being the Lords day I found my Heart in as good a frame as I had any day both in reſpect of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and enlargedneſs in Prayer, and likewiſe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhat from divers Scriptures, eſpecially from 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. From the conſideration of what God had promiſed to do, and the patience and long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Chriſt, and what the Saints did look for, what manner of perſons Chriſtians ought to be, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, growing in Grace and in the knowledge of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I was obſerving from Pſal. 105.8. <hi>How God remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Covenant with his People, yea and for them.</hi> Pſal. 106.47. <hi>alſo his mercy. Pſal.</hi> 98.3. And though they either forget or neglect either the one or the other, yet what abundant comfort is this to Beleivers.</p>
               <p>This day was a very good day to me, in reſpect of ſeveral favours received from the Lord, for which I deſire to be earneſtly thankful, I learned to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how far a man may go with a meer aſcent to truth, without experiencing the power of the ſame working in us, I was alſo earneſt with the Lord that in caſe he did not put an end to my ſufferings, he would put an end to my ſin.</p>

and warmed in Prayer, eſpecially one time, but in the Evening had conviction of my ſlothfulneſs, alſo of my great indiſcretion in diſcourſing about ſpiritual things, I obſerved from Pſal. 129.1, 2. <hi>Many times have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed, that Gods People may be delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and out of affliction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was troubled this day at my ignorance both in natural and ſpiritual things, and had th ough the Lords ſpecial favour to me a ſweet fit of ſorrow, and repentance for my ſins, with two ſpecial ſuitable Scriptures, <hi>he ſhall redeem</hi> Iſrael <hi>from all his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> Pſal. 130.8. and Hoſ. 3.1. <hi>Go yet love a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beloved of her Freind, yet an adultereſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the love of the Lord,</hi> oh what kind of love is this for God to love an Adultereſs, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to a poor Backſlider, for to ſuch theſe words are cheifly ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Through the conſtant coming, and continuing of Freinds, I had little time for ſecret duties, which together with the ſaying of a grave Gentleman that this 40 years he had not neglected to read every day two or three Chapters in the Bible, what ever his buſineſs were, convinced of my neglects in the ſervice of God, this day I met with a new affliction which too little affected me.</p>
               <p>This day the Lord was pleaſed to ſet my thoughts on ſeveral Leſſons, which Chriſtians ſhould be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this day as (1.) <hi>To be humbled under the mighty hand of God,</hi> 1.

To lay to Heart the ſins of the wicked, and the ſins and ſufferings of the godly. (5.) To keep up their Watch. (6.) <hi>Not to neglect Saints fellowſhip,</hi> Heb. 10.29. (7.) To get fuller aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

                  </gap>navoidable tryal may come upon the Saints. 2. That true Saints will be more feareful of the leaſt ſin then the greateſt ſuffering. 3. That Faith in God, a diſregard of the World, and a devine reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution will carry Chriſtians through ſufferings, <hi>I</hi> had my Heart drawn out in Prayer.</p>
               <p>This day <hi>I</hi> took notice of three or four remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Providences, <hi>I</hi> was alſo convinced of too much natural and ſelf-reſolution, alſo of my cowardlyneſs to reprove ſin in great Perſons, <hi>I</hi> conſidered what an evil, and ſin it is for one to attribute to himſelf more then is due, and conſidering how God may make one condition beſt for one one time, which is not beſt at another time, <hi>I</hi> had ſome refreſhing in Prayer this day.</p>
               <p>This day in the morning there was a providence which <hi>I</hi> met with, which is like to prove in the end very remarkable, but whether my acting and appearing therein was from the Lord, <hi>I</hi> muſt leave the iſſue to manifeſt it, only from thence <hi>I</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving 1. That Truth and Sincerity, right ends, asking Counſel of God, and adviſing with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. Firſt, Is great ſatisfaction to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in what he doth. Secondly, Yet when a mans judgement, and Conſcience is not fully in a mans buſineſs, he loſeth much comfort in what he doth.</p>
               <p>Lhis day in the morning <hi>I</hi> had trouble in my Spirit, for what <hi>I</hi> did doubtfully the day before, and ſhed many tears for my dear Brethren that turned Quakers eſpecially <hi>Thomas Ell, I</hi> had alſo comfort from that Scripture Pſal. 138.7. <hi>Though I walk in the midſt of trouble</hi> &amp;c. In the Evening I had conſideration and ſight of ſeveral things amiſs in me, and had my Heart affected in asking for the ſame.</p>

                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:43443:51"/>This morning <hi>I</hi> was troubled for a vile thought, and in the Evening troubled at my impatience yet had ſweet and comfortable refreſhing from <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.35. and a Heart to pray ſenſibly and affectionately for Gods People, and my hope raiſed for them f om Pſal. 125.3. <hi>For the Rod of the wicked ſhall not alwayes reſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This day being the Lords day <hi>I</hi> had comfort from that Scripture, Prov. 24.16. <hi>For a juſt man falleth ſeven times and riſeth up again,</hi> and likewiſe from <hi>Iames</hi> 5 15. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5 8. eſpecially from that place, Gen. 3.21. <hi>Where God is ſaid to make Clothes to</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve, <hi>and not only ſo but to Cloath them, or put them on, from</hi> Dan. 3.17, 18. <hi>I</hi> obſerved that real Saints do fear the leaſt ſin more then the g eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſufferings, becauſe ſin is a worſe evil then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. 2. Becauſe therein they do imitate Ch iſt ſuffering. 3. Becauſe the evil of ſuffering conſiſts with the ſpecial will and pleaſure of God, but ſo doth not ſin. 4. Becauſe they know that if they ſin they ſhall ſuffer. 5. Becauſe they know if they chuſe ſufferings they ſhall be either ſaved from it, or carried through it. 6. Becauſe they are under the promiſe if they ſuffer, but under the Threats and Judgements of God if they ſin.</p>
               <p>This day being a day of writing to ſome Freinds, <hi>I</hi> found my affection quickened more eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one Brother that did abide loving and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and for ſome others that had turned aſide. <hi>I</hi> obſerved this from <hi>Eves</hi> words, Gen. 4.1. <hi>That one may receive a mercy from the Lord, which may not be uſed for the Lord.</hi>

               <p>This Morning I obſerved a ſpecial providence by the coming of a Freind to viſit me, and obſerved further from Prov. 17.5. <hi>Howbeit Gods affliction is compared to a fining Pot or Furnace, to try and purge the Heart,</hi> alſo what a ſad thing tis to have good opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities and prizes put into our hands, but to want improving hearts, or to have corruption hinder good, <hi>verſe</hi> 16, 20.

               <p>This day (being willing to wait upon God,) I found him good to me in ſoftening and inlarging, and drawing out my Heart in Prayer, and I had ſome comfort from thoſe words, Pſal. 9.9. <hi>The Lord will be a refuge for the oppreſſed, a refuge in times of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and verſe the 18. <hi>the needy ſhall not alwayes be forgotten,</hi> yet this Evening I was ſet upon by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which in part prevailed and in part was reſiſted.</p>

aſſaults in the mind, but by his viſible appearances ſometimes in one ſhape, ſometimes in another, to terrifie and afright him, eſpecialy in Prayer and in his drawing nigh unto the Lord, but by Faith he ſtill got the victory over him.</p>
            <p>He in a little time profited above many, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very zealous and full of Love to Chriſt, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir himſelf exceedingly in preaching the Goſpel, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring therein more abundantly then any we have known giving himſelf wholly to the work both in publick &amp; private, God alſo accompanying him with his bleſſing and preſence in great ſucceſs, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity of the Country being then as Feilds, white unto the Harveſt, flock ardently to his Miniſtry, and many by his Preaching were turned to the Lord, ſo that <hi>Radnorſhire</hi> that before was a dark Country, came to have much light and in a ſhort ſpace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eminent Profeſſors begotten in it, at which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan begun to rage exceedingly and ſtirred up ſome of his Inſtruments to perſecute the truth, laying wait for his life and liberty, ſome by a judicial way, ſome by violence till they drove him out of the Country, from whence he went to <hi>London</hi> where in the time of the War he continued ſometime, he was called to <hi>Dartford</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> where he was very ſuccesfull in his Miniſtry to the gathering of a Church, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards times growing more peaceable, he was called into <hi>Wales</hi> again, where he renewed his former la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, preaching the Word in ſeaſon and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo that by him Chriſt made manifeſt the ſavor of his knowledge and grace in every place through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Country, inſomuch that there was but few (if any) of the Churches, Chappels, Town halls in <hi>Wales</hi> wherein he did not preach Chriſt, Yea very often upon Mountains, and very frequent in Fairs, and Markets, it was admirable to conſider how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43443:69"/>
he was by his often preaching in two or three places a day, and ſeldome two dayes in a week throughout the year out of the Pulpit, nay he would ſometimes ride a hundred miles in a week, and Prrach in every place where he might have admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion both day and night, if he paſſed through any Fair, or Market, or near any great concourſe of People (ſo great was his love to Souls) he would take the oppertunity in his Journey to preach Chriſt, yea his whole life was a continual preaching, giving ſeaſonable inſtruction to every body he met with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruitful and exemplary in Word, Doctrine, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, Spirit, it was his cuſtome where ever he came to leave ſome ſpiritual inſtructions and gracious favour behind him.</p>
            <p>He was indued with ſuch courage of mind &amp; furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch ability of body, that he went through his work with great delight, many admiting how he was able to hold out, he was an able Miniſter of the new Teſtament, and always in readineſs upon all occaſions to fulfil his Miniſtry, and like the good Houſholder brought forth of his Treaſury, things new and old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very indefatigable in his work, ſpeaking and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes, 3. 4. nay 6, and 7. hours together; he was very faithful in delivering the word of truth, and in explaining it to the meaneſt capacity. and ſtill endeavoured to ſuit his diſcourſe to the occaſion and condition of the Hearers he neither regarded nor feared the frowns, or favours of great men, but faithfully and couragiouſly would warn, and reprove them to their Faces, he was very affectionate in drawing and inviting Sinners to Chriſt, and as ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would here prove the prophane the rebllious <hi>Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi> and Backſliders, and moſt compaſſionately ſympathize with the weak, afflicted and tempted, he was very excellent in the illuſtrating of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43443:69"/>
by familiar Compariſons, Parables and Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes which uſed to be very profitable to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, tending greatly to imprint the truth in their minds, and which was ſo much the way taken by our Saviour that it is ſaid without a Parable he ſpake not, he had a ready wit well read in Hiſtory and Geography, a good natural Phyloſopher and skilled in Phyſick, which greatly furthered his invention, but above all very powerful in prayer, much indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Spirit and an Eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, which was ſo admirably imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his memory, that he was as a Concordance where ever he came, ſo that a Scripture could hardly be named to him, but he could tell you the Chapter and Verſe, he had ſuch an admirable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory that if he heard two or three Sermons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he could repeate them verbatim, though to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his latter end by his long impriſonment, being kept from the exerciſe of his Gifts his memory was impaired.</p>
            <p>He was very exact in keeping punctual to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times of Preaching, having divers Lectures both Weekly, Fornightly, Monthly and two Months, and Quarterly beſides, extraordinary appointments both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> from which no ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Froſt nor Snow, nor ordinary difficulties could hinder.</p>
            <p>One time as he was going to Preach his Horſe fell lame, and could not well reach the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed on Foot, he being in a great ſtraight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of the way that one <hi>David ap Hugh</hi> took in like caſe and addreſſed to it, <hi>viz.</hi> alighted off his Horſe and went to Prayer and begged ſtrength of God both for himſelf, and Horſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Journey which accordingly was made good to him, for mounting his Horſe he found his lam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

was departed.</p>
            <p>One time he was to Preach at <hi>Lempſter</hi> in <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> upon a firſt day of the week, having the day before preached by the way, and as he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing late at night, he had a very greivous fall off his Horſe, which bruiſed him much that he could not come further that night, and queſtioned whether he ſhould be able to ſtir the next day yet Prayer being made he was inabled to reach the place early in the morning, and to preach thrice that day.</p>
            <p>Another time he was to preach at a place called <hi>Cery,</hi> to perform which he was conſtrained to ride night and day, until at laſt his Horſe tired, ſo that he was forced to leave him by the way, and perform the reſt of his Journey a Foot.</p>
            <p>It was his uſual cuſtome in riding to places to Preach, if he overtook any aged People going on foot towards the meeting, to ſet them on his Horſe, and to walk himſelf by their ſides, which he would do for miles together.</p>
            <p>Many have been the difficulties, and hardſhips he under went in his itenerant preaching, ſometimes forced to lye in the poor <hi>Welch</hi> houſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mountains where he could find little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation for either Horſe or Man, and yet could as cheerfully ſpend the night in examining and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the poor People, as if he had, had the beſt entertainment in the world, for it was his meat and drink to do his Maſters work, in gaining and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Souls, and it was his cuſtome to reward the poor People, as much for their courſe Bread and Cheeſe, and hard Lodging, as if he had been in the choiſeſt Inn.</p>
            <p>He met many times with very hard meaſure from wicked Drunkards, and debauched Perſons by often lying in wait for his Life, and by many Baffitings
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43443:70"/>
and Stripes which he received from them, and he was ve y much prejudiced by Blows upon his Head, yet freely did he uſe to forgive his moſt miſcheivous and malicious Enemies and Perſecutors, never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting any of them, though he had great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt them, and many freinds that would have righted him and puniſhed them, but patiently did he bear in his body the marks of the Lord Jeſus, and moſt Chriſtianly did he undergo all the unjuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches he met with from wicked men, rendring bleſſings for curſings love for harted, he uſed to ſay he would not take a great deal by the year for the reproaches he met with, all for Chriſt which he could not be without.</p>
            <p>He was exceeding hoſpitable, the Feaſts that he uſed to make was not for the rich, but the poor and aged, whom he often invited and ſupplyed with Clothes, Shoos, Stockings, and all other neceſſary accommodations.</p>
            <p>He was very free in the entertainment of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and all Saints, his houſe being common for them, and great reſort was to him from moſt parts of <hi>Wales,</hi> and many from <hi>England,</hi> and was ſo free harted that he would uſe to ſay he had room for twelve in his Beds, a hundred in his Barns, and a thouſand in his heart, and ſo liberal that he would wrong himſelf to do good to others, he was very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to all poor People, and when in the greateſt haſt he would not let the poor cry in vain, and ſeverally would he with his Alms impart ſome good inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their Souls.</p>
            <p>He was very loving and courteous to all his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and much beloved by them.</p>
            <p>He was very zealous againſt falſe doctrine and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors corrupt and anti-Chriſtian dece vers.</p>
            <p>He did ſpend and was ſpent in his Maſters ſervice,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43443:71"/>
laying out himſelf, and what he had for him, not ſerving him for filthy lucre but of a ready mind, finding his wages in his work, and therefore having freely received he freely gave, little outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage accrued to him by his miniſtry, from the Churches in <hi>Wales,</hi> he received nothing but neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly and brotherly kindneſs, which he was as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to requite, and much more willing to give then receive, and as freely did he contribute the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others as any, the Parliament ordered him 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> out of a <hi>ſine cura</hi> whereof he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived about 60 <hi>l.</hi> for ſeven or eight years, many conſiderable gifts he refuſed, and never did he get any thing by the Act for the propagation of the Goſpel in <hi>Wales,</hi> as was ſlandrouſly laid to his charge, for which his vindication in print to this day unanſwered, may ſtop the mouth of Envy it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And he made it appear in the Conſciences of all that knew him that wealth, and worldly advantages was not the penny he entred the Vineyard for, but the gaining of Souls, his temporal Eſtate as well known was more before the War, then at the time of his impriſonment and death, being indeed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſer of the world, and which was no more his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then it was <hi>Luthers,</hi> he was of a noble gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous free Spirit, and as ſome term it much a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in all his deportment.</p>
            <p>He was very humble and plain in his carriage pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering others before himſelf, though far inferiour in Gifts and Grace to him, and a moſt ready ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to do good to all both for Soul and Body.</p>
            <p>He was very juſt in all his dealings and would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receive wrong, then offer injury to any, and kept ſtill a great jealouſy over himſelf leaſt he ſhould do any thing unbecoming the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>He was very pittiful to all in diſtreſs whether

Saints or ſinners, and eſpecially in the caſe of ſin, which he would deeply lay to heart, and weep bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly in conſideration of the weightineſs of ſin upon there Souls, and greatly would he lament the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous offences in Profeſſors, which tended ſo much to the diſhonou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dening of ſinners, and indangering their own Souls.</p>
            <p>He was very active in doing good, and little time ſpent by him in idleneſs, after great and tedious Journeys and pains in Preaching, he would be as freſh to attend any work for God, as if there had been no ſuch thing, it was his conſtant practice to be ſpeaking of good to all he converſed with, and to convert worldly diſcourſe into ſpiritual things, and when he apprehended any to diſcourſe of the things of God in a common light Spirit, he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to work them up to more ſeriouſneſs and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallity.</p>
            <p>Where ever he was, at home or abroad, he would be ſtill furthering of good things, and improve all oppertunities with whom ſo ever he converſed were it in his Journey; or upon the Road to inſtil ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the good and benefit of their Souls, wherein as a follower of his Maſter, he was a lively pattern to the Saints, and wherein God bleſſed him exceedingly.</p>
            <p>He was to receive exhortation admonition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, (being under all his excellencies &amp; great worth a man ſubject to paſſion &amp; infirmity) which he would imbrace with all humble ſubmiſſion and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thankfulneſs, and his Conſcience was ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he would of himſelf both privately and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly expreſs his fears and jealouſie of himſelf, and would deſire others to tell him his faults which he might not ſo well diſcern in himſelf.</p>
            <p>He was a faithful and diligent obſerver of the out
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43443:72"/>
goings of God upon his Soul, whereof he kept a dayly account and record, taking notice both of the actings of grace, and the ſtirrings of corruption, and the aſſaults of ſin and Satan, or World made upon him.</p>
            <p>It was his dayly practice to draw forth ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and advantage from every object, and every thing that accrued, <hi>viz.</hi> from Scriptures or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Gods dealings with him in every reſpect from conferrences with Saints, or Sinners, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny providence or accident whether proſperous or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from Creatures Heaven, Earth, Seaſons, from the graces, and vertues as well as failings and infirmities of Saints and Profeſſors.</p>

            <p>He was very heavenly, his Heart ſo ſet with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and intentneſs upon the things of God, that when he was alone, and none to diſcourſe with, he would many times be ſinging of Hymns in his houſe and elſewhere, and often in his Bed aſſoon as he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked in the morning, being excellent at extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pory Hymns, which have been to the refreſhing of many, who have declared to have injoyed as much of God in joyning with him therein, as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinance.</p>
            <p>And his Soul did follow ſo hard after God, that he hath been heard to pray very audibly and fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his ſleep, and yet knew it not vvhen he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaked.</p>
            <p>He vvas of an undanted courage for God, no fear of ſuffering could turn him back in the vvork of the Lord, he had ſuch a fervent zeal for Chriſt, and the Truth, and ſuch enmity to, and hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, that he regarded not the greatneſs of men,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43443:72"/>
in adminiſtring reproof to them, vvhat danger ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver might accur to him thereby, he uſed to ſay he feared the corruption of his Heart more then any ſufferings he met vvith from men.</p>

            <p>He vvas one of a vvorthy publick Spirit zealous in, and furthering of all things that might tend to promote the good of his Neighbour and Nation, but eſpecially the Saints, and <hi>Sion,</hi> in advancing the Name, Intereſt, Kingdome, and Soveraignty of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and ſeting himſelf withal his might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Babilon</hi> that common publick Enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>He was very tender of the Conſciences of others, though differing in judgement from him, and where he diſcerned ſincerity, and truth of Grace, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed much endeared affection to them as Brethren, being a dear Lover and Promoter of love to Saints as Saints, without relation to perticular perſwaſion, or private opinion.</p>
            <p>He was exceeding ſucceſsful in the work of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, which was ſealed to him by the converſion of many Souls confirmation, conſolation and edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of more both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was inſtrumental to the gathering of Churches, to the healing and compoſing of many differences and breaches, wherein he travelled much by Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers Letters, Conferrences and Journeys far and near.</p>
            <p>It was his uſual courſe in order to preſerve and maintain life and love amongſt the Churches, he

moſt neerly converſed with, to put them upon the debating and reſolving of ſeveral queſtions from time to time, he handed to them which proved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding profitable to the increaſe of knowledge, and to the ends propoſed.</p>
            <p>He was much in viſiting from houſe to houſe, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a particular account both of inward and outward man, inquiring after their family, walks, duties, and deportments, and in an eſpecial manner did he with diligence attend the ſick, adminiſtring all things neceſſary for Body and Soul, Exhorting, Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Praying with and for them.</p>
            <p>He was exceeding zealous to keep the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clean and pure, by keeping a diligent Watch, puting forth early warning and reproof againſt the firſt appearances of envy, and ſcandal, and a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rejecting the hardened and impenitent Sinners, in which Caſes he uſed to be mighty powerful in the adminiſtring of that ordinance of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhewing the terribleneſs thereof ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearts would tremble greatly thereat, and yet be found alſo therein with great tenderneſs, and heart meltings to the offenders themſelves.</p>
            <p>As he was Maſter of a Family, he was wonderful careful to do the things that was juſt and equal, and principally he did deſign to promote the power of godlideſs amongſt his Servants, he uſed to tell them that they ſhould at any time leave work to pray or read, and when he ſound them at any times in the Feilds reading or confering about the things of God, he would bid them go on and continue in it, and oh how few are they that prefer and promote the good of Souls, before their own worldly profit &amp; advantage, but are rather ſo oppreſſing their Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thoſe Servants that he ſaw careleſs of their Souls, or ſleep in duties not remembring what they heard, he would charge warn and rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When his occaſion led him abroad to preach which was very often, he left with them ſtrict charge to perform the Family duties amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>As he was a houſekeeper had all things provided decently and in good order, his Husbandry and all his affairs well contrived and managed with great diſcretion.</p>
            <p>This following account ſo well agreeing with the former, and given in by his dear Wife Mr. <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine Powel</hi> is thought meet here to be inſerted.</p>

            <p>A man very conſcientious and exemplary in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative duties, and very punctual to his word, if he promiſed any thing it was as binding to him as the moſt legal obligation, he was naturally of a haſty ſpirit which if at any time brake out, he would in a ſhort ſpace recover himſelf, and come out of it return to as ſweet and amiable a frame of ſpirit as could be deſired, and candidly acknowledge his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and mourn over it.</p>

                  <p>After ſome Moneths ſtay, the Seſſions came, and after much importunity Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> was called, and inſtead of being releaſed, or having any juſt cauſe rendred why he ſhould ſtill be continued in Priſon, <hi>the Oaths of Supreamacy and Allegiance</hi> were tendred to him, and though he urged, that it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he ſhould firſt be cleared of that which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready charged upon him, before he entred upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new Matter, eſpecially ſince thoſe Oaths were deſigned againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who he ſaw were ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of him, as to any inclinableneſs unto Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

                  <p>But he had not long continued here, when upon a falſe information returned againſt him, one of the Meſſengers of the Council (Mr. <hi>Wick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moneths of that time, in ſo cloſe a Confinement that he was not ſuffered to go out of his Chamber Door, which, together with the offenſive ſmell of a Dunghil, which was juſt before his Window, did ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his Health, that he never after perfectly recovered it.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> was thus a Priſoner in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> his Enemies could not ſatisfie themſelves by exerciſing cruelty upon his Body, but they alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to take away his good name and credit, by ſpreading a Report that he was in Priſon there for a great part of the Revenew of the Tythes of

                     <hi>Wales.</hi> From which Aſperſion though many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Perſons had formerly cleared him, by a Book Printed in the Year 1653. called <hi>Examen &amp; Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament Vavaſeris;</hi> Yet noe knowing how far ſuch a Report might influnece to the reproach of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> did then write a breif Narrative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centing the proceedings of the Commiſſioners in <hi>Wales</hi> againſt the ejected Clergy, and therein, as knowing his own intigrity, he did defy all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to prove the leaſt Title of that Slander; To which Vindication no reply was ever put, nor indeed can be made: ſince all that knew Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> muſt affirm this of him, that very few in this Self ſeeking Age were more of the Primitive temper, in ſeeking the <hi>Souls,</hi> rather then the <hi>Goods</hi> of others; which, though preſſed upon him with much importunity, he hath often refuſed; And ſo far was he from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring unjuſtly to enrich himſelf, that he did voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quit the oppertunity of juſtly doing it.</p>
                  <p>Having now ſpent almoſt two years in the Fleet, there came a ſudden order for the ſending away of him and Collonel <hi>Rich,</hi> which without giving them ſo much as two hours time to provide themſelves, was executed upon them, upon the laſt day of <hi>September</hi> 1663. and in the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Pleaſure Boat, whereof Captain <hi>Lambert</hi> was Commander, they were both conveyed to <hi>South-Sea</hi> Caſtle, by <hi>Portſmouth</hi> where Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> continued about five years not being reſtored till the removal of the Chancellour <hi>Hide</hi> did open a Door for him, (as for many other Priſoners) to ſue for his <hi>Habeas Carpus</hi> and ſo at length he obtained his liberty.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> after his releaſe out of <hi>South Sea</hi> Caſtle had ſcarce his liberty ten Moneths, when paſſing from <hi>Briſtol</hi> through ſome Parts of <hi>Monmouth-ſhire,</hi> he having in that County ſeveral opportunities in

divers places to preach the Goſpel: People of all ſorts as well Profane, as Profeſſors ſhewing much willingneſs to embrace the ſame, he judging it his duty being called by the Lord, and deſired by the People, paſſed out of <hi>Monmouth ſhire</hi> into a place called <hi>Mertur</hi> lying in the mountian parts of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan-ſhire,</hi> where he found in the Church-yard of the ſaid Pariſh a great Congregation of People wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear the Word of God: to whom after Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the ſaid <hi>Vavaſor</hi> ſpake from the 17. <hi>Ier. verſe,</hi> 7, 8.

                  <p>But whilſt he was endeavouring to do the Lords work, the Parſon of <hi>Merthur</hi> one <hi>George Iones</hi> a man notoriouſly known in the Country, for many horid vices, (as Whoredome, Drunkeneſs, Cheating and putting away his Wife) poſted away in the time of Sermon to <hi>Cardiff</hi> which was about 12 or 14 miles off, and it being at the end of the Quarter-Seſſions there: he found but two of the Deputy Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants tenants in the Town fudling after thier uſual manner,<note place="margin">Dr. B.</note> to whom the ſaid <hi>Iones</hi> made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and falſe information, nay if one of thoſe Deputy Lieutenants may be credited, he took a falſe Oath, to wit, that the ſaid <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> and the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to which he preached were met near 2 miles from that place, and many of them armed both which were falſe.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sir your own Conſciences and the Countrey know what you do therein, but ſir I deſire again to know what law do you charge the breach of it on me, and by which you impriſon me.</hi>

                     <p>Then the Dr. called to his man to teach him a Satchel or Bag that had ſome writings in it, which he drew out, and took firſt the Act made againſt Conventicles by the preſent Parliament, and gave it Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> and ask'd him whether he had ſeen it.</p>

                        <hi>Yes ſaid</hi> Powel <hi>I have ſeen and conſidered it.</hi>

                        <hi>Firſt I anſwer as I did before, that our Meeting was no Conventicle nor a private but a publick Meeting. Secondly, That it is the opinion of divers learned Lawyers, that that Act is now out of date as ſeems by the laſt proviſo therein and I was upon that Act before a learned Lawyer, and Iuſtice of Peace, who underſtood it in that ſence, and diſcharged me. But, Thirdly, Its apparent you have not proceeded with me according to that Act, for you have apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in my lodging a day after, and not in the exerciſe.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43443:84"/>
Again your Order and Commitment was not as you were Iuſtices of the Peace but Deputy Leiutenants, and ſo your Officer</hi> Major Carn, <hi>when I deſired to ſee his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he laid his hand upon his Sword and ſaid that was his Authority. Again ſir, be pleaſed with the reſt of you Gentlemen, to conſider that my Commitment is not grounded upon that Act, but upon the Lord Lieutenants Letters written ſeveral years before, when I was in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon elſewhere, and yet in</hi> November <hi>laſt, by Order from the King and his Council (to which Order the Lord Lieutenants hand is) I was ſet at liberty.</hi>

                        <hi>So have I been with many other things that are falſe: but Gentlemen I deſire you to take notice how groundleſs that report was, by this inſtance.

it would be civility in you, and ſome ſatisfaction to me to let me ſee it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>We might have tendred the Oaths to you at the laſt meeting.</p>

               <p>For it had been more proper for you to have, done it before you had committed me then either [which was after my firſt commitment ſeveral days,] then or now: But Dr. you have at firſt dealt very ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally by committing me without cauſe or colour of cauſe, and ſo run your ſelf into a Praemunire, and ever ſince your work hath been to ſeek to ſet things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but all the while you do wrong me and the truth, the Lord forgive you.</p>

               <p>Though that I might do ſo, yet I bleſs God I am a Chriſtian, and my principle, as well as my pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, is rather to forgive wrongs, then otherwiſe: leaving and committing my cauſe to God who will plead it, but D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and my order doth plainly ſhew (bearing date <hi>Dec.</hi> 1667) that I was ſet at liberty long after the date of thoſe Letters.</p>

               <p>If I may not know that, I may as well forbear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring whither <hi>I</hi> will take them or no, ſince I am a Priſoner already.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But you muſt give a poſitive anſwer whether you will or will not take them, therefore let us know what your anſwer is?</p>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Since you do preſs me ſo much to give my anſwer, my anſwer then is this, That I have taken them already, and I conceive I am not bound by the Law to take them again, that is my anſwer.</p>

               <speaker>Then Sir <hi>John A.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>made ſome ſign to the Doctor to ſhew Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> the Oaths in the Statute Book: and ſo the Doctor ſought them but could not readily find them, then the Town Clerk went to help him, and one of them ſaid the Oath of Allegiance was in <hi>decimo ſexto Jacobi,</hi> the other Doctor ſaid it was in another place, but neither of them knew where.</p>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, Are you ſo unacquainted with the Law? the Oath of Allegiance which you looke for is in <hi>Tertio Jacobi,</hi> and there you find the occaſion of it, which was the Gunpowder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and that Oath was never intended ſo much againſt Proteſtants (though Non conformiſts) as againſt Popiſh Recuſants, and yet which of them have it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43443:88"/>
upon them, or are impriſoned for want of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Well, will you take them, here they are, and we tender them to you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I have anſwered you already and need give you no other: Yet I will ſay more. That if you can prove that you have power to tender both the Oaths to me, and that I am in either of thoſe capacities, that the Statutes <hi>primo</hi> or <hi>quinto Eliz.</hi> mentions, I will take them, but I know you cannot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

                  <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Well, will you put that anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your hand, and ſo tender Mr. P. paper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> am free to put it under my hand, but you may if you pleaſe return my anſwer, if you muſt return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at all. But Sir <hi>John A.</hi> and the Doctor could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in that particular how Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſhould do it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But we have power to give that Oath to you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, if you have, I ſay again, I will take it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore peruſe that Statute; ſo Sir <hi>Iohn A.</hi> looked into the Statute, and ſpake ſomewhat to the Doctor privately, which ſeems by the Drs. anſwer to him was, that they could not. For the Drs. anſwer was, but we can.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But why are not you bound as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe that the Statute directs the Oath to be taken by Officers Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, and ſuch as were to receive publick profits, and other perſons mentioned both in that and the other Statute of the Fifth of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and though I may be looked upon as an Eccleſiaſtical perſon, yet it appertains to the Biſhop to give it me.</p>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>If you muſt have yet a more poſitive anſwer, ſince you will neither let me ſee the order requiring me to take them, nor ſhew me that the Law which ought to be your rule, doth impoſe them upon me: though I do not abſolutely and peremptorily refuſe them, yet I will not take them now.</p>

               <p>Here Dr. <hi>B.</hi> interrupted Mr. <hi>P.</hi> in his ſpeech, and cry'd out to ſome preſent to bear witneſs that he ſaid he would not take them: thereupon one in the room ſaid I do bear witneſs.</p>

whether I can and will take them, yea or no, (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little ſilence he went on) and ſaid Theſe two Oath, were framed and impoſed (as I ſuppoſe you well know) the firſt of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Oath of Supremacy, in the firſt year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> immediately after that hot perſecution of the Papiſts in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> days, and it was no doubt intended chiefly againſt Papiſts, and to be a teſt and tryal of all perſons that were admitted into, or continued in any publick Offices, either Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or Eccleſiaſtical. The other Oath of Allegiance or Obedience, was impoſed upon that notorious act, the Gunpowder Treaſon, and the ſubſtance of both of them is to acknowledge the Queen or King of <hi>England</hi> to be the Supream Magiſtrates of theſe Kingdoms, and that no Prince or Forraign power had any right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: nor the Pope nor any other had power to diſſolve or diſcharge any ſubject from their Obedience to the Queen or King, and this power I do freely and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge, and ſo far I do here declare, if it gives you ſatisfaction.</p>

Law &amp; Cuſtom of <hi>England.</hi> The Law of <hi>England</hi> doth not require that men ſhould take the Oaths as often as every Magiſtrate pleaſes to tender them, for as the L. <hi>Cook</hi> that was the glory of the Law, ſhews in the 7th. book of his Reports in the Caſe of <hi>Poſtnati, Calvins</hi> Caſe, a man is bound to take the Oath of Allegiance but once in his life time.

            <p>About three moneths after this, a friend in <hi>London</hi> got a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to remove him to the Common-Pleas Bar, which the Sheriff refuſed to obey, then came an <hi>Alias</hi> under Penalty of a 100 <hi>l.</hi> upon which they ſent him up: but would not let him know of his journey before hand. But about 8 a clock one night the Under Sheriff came to give him notice to be gone in half an hour, and ſo took him with a Guard 8 miles that night, being the 16 of the 8 <hi>moneth,</hi> 1669. and brought him to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to the Common-Pleas Bar the 22 of the ſame. Where upon the Examination of the Return, it was found illegal, but <hi>S. M.</hi> their Council pleaded he had nor had time to view it, and deſired time till next day, which the Judges granted.

            <p>THe 25 of the 7th moneth, being the firſt day of the week, he preached forenoon and afternoon, many being admitted to hear him, and that with much life and zeal.

which conſtrained him to take Coach, &amp; that ſhook him very much, but came to his friends houſe and diſpatched his buſineſs. That night he took one of <hi>Mathews</hi> pills, and ſlept very well, but in the morning after he was up, and had brohe his faſt, fell very ſick and vomited, yet afterwards ſomewhat better again.

one bad thought of God for all the World. The ſight of the pardon of ſin and reconciliation with God was ſo clear and without interruption, even to the laſt, that it was as a fire in his boſom till he ſpake of it, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly would he be reſtrained at any time, and when he had ſpent his ſtrength in ſpeaking, then would he compoſe himſelf to get a little more ſtrength, that he might go on to ſpeak further of the Grace of God towards him, and to give ſeaſonable advice to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and ſo continued till God took away his ſtrength and ſpeech from him. The Thruſh growing ſo ſore in his mouth, that he could ſpeak no more to be underſtood, and yet then by ſigns would ſignifie that all was well within. He enjoyed his underſtanding to the laſt, which he ſaid he had begged of God.

               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:43443:94"/>Theſe 30 years ſince God wrought upon me, I do not remember that ever I had one hard thought of God, nor repent me that I did make a Profeſſion nor progreſs in the ways of God, notwithſtanding all my reproaches and ſufferings. But have had much cauſe to wonder at Jeſus Chriſt, that hath called me an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done ſinner, me an undone ſinner, and counted me, me a vile wretch, worthy to ſuffer any thing for his names ſake; and this he did ſpeak with ſo much broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſpend his ſtrength ſo much that thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an friends that were near unto him, did entreat him to compoſe himſelf if it might pleaſe God to give him a little reſt, and at another time to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>I have been much conſidering, ſince I was upon my ſick bed, how the Lord Jeſus, whilſt upon the Earth, carried it to poor ſinners, and am much ſatisfied that it is a great fault among Churches and Chriſtians that they have no more pitty and bowels to poor ſinners, and uſe no more means to gain them unto Jeſus Chriſt; further adding, that Jeſus Chriſt had ſuch compaſſion to ſinners when he was upon the Earth, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was called a friend of Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>After ſome time of ſilence, he breaks out in theſe words: Oh now I find more in that word then ever I did, they overcame by the blood of the Lamb. Though God hath given me a very tender, good, and affectionate Wife, yet I do not grudge to part with her to go to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When a Chriſtian friend ſpeaking to him, ſaid, that now he had a great deal to take comfort in, both in what he had ſuffered for Chriſt, ſo and in that he had been an inſtrument to convert ſo many ſouls to Chriſt. He anſwered, that his Religion now was
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43443:95"/>
in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, Sincerity, and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>He did bleſs God that it was not now with him as it was in <hi>South-Sea-Caſtle,</hi> becauſe there he had no friends about him to do any ſervice of love for him as now he had.</p>
            <p>When there was ſome hopes of recovery, his wife asking him whether he would be willing to ſtay with us if God ſhould reſtore him, anſwered, I am willing to do what God will have me, but yet unwilling to come back again into the ſtorm.</p>
            <p>When his friends endeavoured to keep him from ſpeaking, he ſaid, you reſtrain me, and will not let me ſpeak for Jeſus Chriſt, and then would weep and grieve that he was not permitted to ſpeak as much as he would.</p>
            <p>When he ſpoke of ſufferings to come, he gave two words of advice, to the Saints, and thoſe that were round about him; as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To keep all things clear betwixt Chriſt and the Soul, and Chriſt and Conſcience, that there might be no ſin to offend Chriſt, neither in the guilt, nor filth of it, nor no grace counterfeited nor corrupted to provoked Chriſt, nothing eſpouſed to ſteal away the affections from Chriſt, but that the ſoul ſtand clear in its faith and love, and every grace, and ſtand looſe from duties, ordinances, neareſt and deareſt relations, that ſo there might be no cauſe of difference betwixt Chriſt and the ſoul.</p>
            <p>That Chriſtians ſhould be faithful to the death; for he that indureth to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Another time ſpeaking to the Dr. returning him thanks for his Cure, told him, <hi>Contra vim mortis, non eſt medicamen in hortis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another time, after he had been compoſing himſelf to reſt, and had ſlept awhile, he awoke, and ſaid, He
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43443:95"/>
had been with <hi>Paul, Harriſon, Craddocke,</hi> and others of the Saints deceaſed. At another time, that he was brought into a fine pleaſant Garden, where he ſaw a fine Manſion houſe on one ſide of it, into which he was to go; but he was had on the other ſide of the Garden, where there was a thing like a Coffin made up with deal Boards, from whence he was afterwards brought to the Manſion houſe; was ſatisfied in his dream, that that was his paſſage through the grave to glory, and did then again ſay, that all would be in vain that was done to him; however did aſſure thoſe that were concerned about him, that their Labours ſhould not be in vain, but God would remember it as a kindneſs done to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Another time he expreſſes himſelf after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Sad times will come, and many of them that ſtand now will fall, ſome ſhall be put into Priſon, ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſhed, ſome baniſhed, and ſome put to death, and the Saints ſcattered, ſo that their differences ſhall be done away; when they are in their greateſt diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then the Lord will appear for them, and will ſave them with a mighty hand.</p>
            <p>In his ſickneſs, he beged of God that he would pleaſe to continue his underſtanding, in which God did graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly anſwer him, even to the laſt, to the admiration of the Dr.</p>
            <p>Did very often and very earneſtly preſs the Saints to be of one heart, and to lay aſide all their differences.</p>
            <p>About praying for Magiſtrates, ſaid, I have been blamed and judged by ſome Chriſtian friends that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from me, for that liberty I took, as if I had backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from my former Principles, which the Lord knows I did not out of fear, but according to my Principles and Conſcience, yet do now ſee that in ſome things therein I was right, and in ſome things wrong; To pray for them as ſinners, that God would ſhew them
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43443:96"/>
their ſins, therein I was right, but ſince ſuch a time (naming the time) God hath ſhewed me, that prayer ſhould not be put up for them as Magiſtrates, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med two Scriptures.</p>
